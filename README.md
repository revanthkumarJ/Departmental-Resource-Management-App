# 📌 Departmental Resource Management App  

## 🚀 Project Status  
I have started working on this project and plan to include the following features:  

## Overview  
The **Departmental Resource Management App** is a mobile application designed to streamline **classroom booking, announcements, timetable management, and faculty-student interactions** within a department.  
It serves as a centralized platform for **students, Class Representatives (CRs), faculty, the Head of the Department (HOD), and an admin**, with each user role having specific privileges to ensure smooth communication and efficient resource management.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
✅ **MVVM Architecture** for structured and maintainable code.  
✅ **Kotlin Jetpack Compose** for building a modern and responsive UI.  
✅ **Ktor** for handling API requests efficiently.  
✅ **Firebase** for storage and real-time notifications.  
✅ **KOIN** for dependency injection, ensuring modular and testable code.  
✅ **GitHub** for version control and future collaboration.
